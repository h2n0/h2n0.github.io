		<p>Well, that didn't guite go to plan. I started well and then, droped off</br>
		a proverbialbe cliff, so that was fun.</p>

		<p>My Idea was simple with me and my brother we where going to make a simple</br>
		tile based farming game where you start with a single seed and have to obtain</br>
		1 million seeds to win simple. After we decided how the game should play I started</br>
		the coding side of things while he played GTA5</p>

		<p>The idea was that the game would be tile based because thats what I like to use
		however thats not how it worked out, I started by stetting up the level class the
		way I normally would then give them an abstact tick method so that all tiles could
		tick diffrently from one an other. But this is where my problems started
		I didn't notice the problem at firt it wasn't until the second day that I realized what
		was happening. All of the tiles where updating with the same tick for example
		if a piece of dirt was surrounded by water it would turn to a darker shade indecating that
		it was hydrated and that crops could grow on it now when this happend all of the dirt became
		'hydrated' and for whatever reason I could not find the bug for the life of me.</p>

		<p>EDIT: The Good we got a solid dea straight out, the art was good & time managment was good
		The Bad: Everything fell aprt because of  small bug that broke the game :(

		So for next time I'll use a diffrent approach for tile beased ticking so this don't happen again
		And I'll do a warm up so I know it does work.
